function Epi = Epipolar(img,R,T,x,y)
%EPIPOLAR Summary of this function goes here
%   This function calculates the corresponding epipolar line of a given
%   image and a given relative position

%   Input: img is the image to calculate epipolar line for a given point.R
%   and T represent the relative position to the image calculated and x,y
%   is the coordinate of the given point.

%   Output: A n x 2 matrix where n is the number of points on the epipolar
%   line. The columns represent x and y coordinates.
