function [R,T] = Relative(R1,T1,R2,T2)
%UNTITLED Summary of this function goes here
%   This function calculates the relative R and T of position2 with respect
%   to position1
%   Inputs: T1 and R1 are the postion and orientation of position1; T2 and
%   R2 are the position and orientation of position2
%   Outputs: R and T are the position and orientation of position2 with
%   respect to position1
R = eye(3);
T = zeros(3);
